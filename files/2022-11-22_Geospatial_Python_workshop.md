## üîß Exercises

#### Exercise: find the axes units of the CRS

What units are our data in? See if you can find a method to examine this information using `help(crs)` or `dir(crs)`


#### Exercise: set the plotting aspect ratio

Plotting a satellite image can lead to a "stretched" image. Let‚Äôs visualize it with the right aspect ratio. You can use the [documentation](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.plot.imshow.html) of `DataArray.plot.imshow()`.



#### Exercise: Import Line and Point Vector Datasets
Using the steps above, load the waterways and groundwater well vector datasets (`data/status_vaarweg.zip` and `data/brogmwvolledigeset.zip`, respectively) into Python using `geopandas`. Name your variables `waterways_nl` and `wells_nl` respectively.

Answer the following questions:

- What type of spatial features (points, lines, polygons) are present in each dataset?
- What is the CRS, give the EPSG ID.
- What is the total extent (bounds) of each dataset?
- How many spatial features are present in each file?


How to get the answers for the waterways:
```python=
waterways = gpd.read_file("data/status_vaarweg.zip")
```
```python=
waterways.type.unique()
```
```python=
waterways.crs
```
```python=
waterways.total_bounds
```



## üß† Collaborative Notes
### Read and visualize raster data
To prepare:
```python=
import rioxarray
import pystac
```

```python=
items = pystac.ItemCollection.from_file("search.json")
items
```

```python=
href = items[0].assets["B09"].get_absolute_href()
href
```

```python=
raster_ams_b9 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(href)
```

Plot it:
```python
raster_ams_b9.plot()
```

Inspect the DataArray:
```python
raster_ams_b9
```

Coordinate reference system:
```python
raster_ams_b9.rio.crs
```

Value to encode missing value
```python
raster_ams_b9.rio.nodata
```

Bounding box:
```python
raster_ams_b9.rio.bounds()
```

Show the values, data will be loaded in memory the first time you run this:
```python
raster_ams_b9.values
```

Plotting will need the actual data, first time you plot the data will be loaded in memory.
```python
raster_ams_b9.plot()
```

Fix the contrast:
```python
raster_ams_b9.plot(robust=True)
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/XjHhdtW.png)

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in python
Get the EPSG code number:
```python
epsg = raster_ams_b9.rio.crs.to_epsg()
```

Get more information about this CRS:
```python=
import pyproj
```

```python=
crs = pyproj.CRS(epsg)
```

```python=
crs.area_of_use
```

To check the units of our axes:
```python=
crs.axis_info
```

### Calculating raster statistics
Minimum value:
```python=
raster_ams_b9.min()
```

Other interesting statistics
```python
raster_ams_b9.max()
raster_ams_b9.mean()
raster_ams_b9.std()
```

You can also use (some)numpy functions on dataarrays and get a data array back:
```python
import numpy as np
np.min(raster_ams_b9)
```

Mask the nodata values, they will be represented as `numpy.nan` now. Integers will be converted to floats:
```python
raster_ams_b9_nodata = rioxarray.open_rasterio(href, masked=True)
raster_ams_b9_nodata
```



Plot our masked array
```python=
raster_ams_b9_nodata.plot()
```

Check the statistics again. They have changed because the 0 values are not taken into account anymore:
```python
raster_ams_b9_nodata.min()
raster_ams_b9_nodata.mean()
```

Note that the following is a lot more typing (but avoids conversion to float): `raster_ams_b9.data[raster_ams_b9.data!=raster_ams_b9._FillValue].min()`


Let's inspect the "overview" asset
```python=
overview_href = items[0].assets["overview"].get_absolute_href()
```

```python=
overview = rioxarray.open_rasterio(overview_href)
overview
```

Like numpy, you can inspect the shape of the data array
```python=
overview.shape
```

The plot will look different because it has multiple layers:
```python=
overview.plot()
```

To display it as an image:
```python
overview.plot.imshow()
```

### Break until 10:48!

### Vector data in Python
#### Data
Make sure you have the data:
üìö Download files:
- [brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/37729413)
- [brogmwvolledigeset.zip](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/37729416)
- [status_vaarweg.zip](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/37729419)

Satellite imagery search result:
- [search.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2022-11-21-dc-geospatial/main/files/search.json)

Let's start by importing geopandas
```python=
import geopandas as gpd
```

Load our data
```python=
cropfield = gpd.read_file("data/brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg")
```

Let's view it:
```python=
cropfield
```

Check documentation of `gpd.read_file`
```python=
gpd.read_file?
```

Let's pretend the file is big and investigate only part of it:
```python=
cropfield = gpd.read_file("data/brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg", rows=10)

cropfield
```

Use bbox argument to only load data that is in the same area as our previous sattelite data

Inspect coordinate system:
```python=
cropfield.crs
```

```python=
minx, miny, maxx, maxy = (110_000, 475_000, 140_000, 500_000)
bbox = (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)

bbox
```

Load the data one more time, with limited extent this time:
```python=
cropfield = gpd.read_file("data/brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg", bbox=bbox)
cropfield
```

Load directly from url `https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/3772941`3 :
```python=
test_data = gpd.read_file("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/37729413")
```

Check the type of our cropfield data (spoiler alert: it's a `GeoDataFrame`)
```python=
type(cropfield)
```

Check the type of your geometry column:
```python=
cropfield.type
```

Check all the unique types in your geometry column:
```python=
cropfield.type.unique()
```

Check crs again
```python=
cropfield.crs
```

Check bounding box of your GeoDataFrame:
```python=
cropfield.total_bounds
```

```python=
cropfield.plot()
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/TuOs1LH.png)

Select a smaller area using slicing
```python=
xmin, xmax = (120_000, 135_000)
ymin, ymax = (485_000, 500_000)
cropfield = cropfield.cx[xmin:xmax, ymin:ymax]
```

plot our smaller area
```python=
cropfield.plot()
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/YSFZHHx.png)


Save our selected data to disk as a shapefile:
```python=
cropfield.to_file("cropfield.shp")
```

### :coffee: :tea: Break until 11:50! 


```python=
waterways = gpd.read_file("data/status_vaarweg.zip")
waterways.type.unique()
waterways.crs
waterways.total_bounds
```

Visualize waterways:
```python
waterways.plot()
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/8u1lhP0.png)

Inspect coordinates of waterways
```python
print(waterways["geometry"][0])
```

Inspect coordinates of cropfields
```python
print(cropfield["geometry"][0])
```

Flipping x and y coordinates:
```python
import shapely
```
```python
def flip(geometry):
    return shapely.ops.transform( lambda x, y: (y, x), geometry)
```
```python
type(waterways)
```

```python
waterways["geometry"] = waterways["geometry"].apply(flip)
waterways.plot()
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/AsU78YD.png)

Save corrected waterways to shp file:
```python
waterways.to_file("waterways_corrected.shp")
```

### Crop raster
Import the necessary libraries
```python
import pystac
import rioxarray
```

```python
items = pystac.ItemCollection.from_file("search.json")
items
```

Pick the second item:
```python
item = items[1]
item
```

inspect the assets:
```python
item.assets
```

Load the metadata of the "visual" asset
```python
item_href = item.assets["visual"].href
true_color_image = rioxarray.open_rasterio(item_href)
true_color_image
```

## Tips/Tops

### :-1: Tip: what to improve
- Spend a bit less time of Python generics 
- These are very useful tools and more could hvae been shown about their specific features, rather than spending lots of time on simple python executions like reading and slicing
- share all links of your pages beforehand (I meant the pages only)
- For me, I would like a bit more introduction/overview of the benefits of processing geodata with Python compared to say ArcMap or QGIS.
- Maybe spending a bit less time on recaps might help having more time for later explanations
- A lot of time is spend on python aspects of handling data, where Python knowledge was a prerequisite for this workshop?
- Not sure how to handle the different coord systems...
- Can you give some small projects for exercising and future l

### :+1: Top: what went well
- The example of amending incorrect coordinates was really insightful
- Nice examples, and nice trouble-shooting
- Learn a lot, nice exercises and examples
- Great workshop format - I would definetly sign up for another
- Plenty of room for questions, elaboration, and problem-solving. Good job! (x2)
- I liked the reading file
- Very helpful and illustrative workshop
